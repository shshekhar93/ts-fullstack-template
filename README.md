A fullstack Typescript application using ExpressJS for server and ReactJS for frontend. 

Its mostly been developed for my personal use, and consiquently includes opinionated decisions w.r.t. libraries being included in the bootstrap. Feel free to use it as is, if the same works for you. Or, fork it and update it with your favourite libraries and frameworks to have a quick and easy way for setting up your customized template.


# What works
- [x] Setup the fullstack application based on template from repo main branch.
- [x] Update the name description etc in package.json based on user input.

# To be impletemented
- [ ] Include parameters to accept template zip and configuration so that it can used with updated forks without the need to re-publish the executable package.
- [ ] Configuration to select branch from which to download the template.
- [ ] Multiple versions (to include db in bootatrap etc)
- [ ] Partial template to add a functionality (eg db) in existing projects.
